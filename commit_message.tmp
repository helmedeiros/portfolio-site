feat: replace hero placeholder with professional photo display

This commit updates the hero section to display the user's actual professional
photo instead of a static placeholder, creating a more personal and engaging
first impression for website visitors.

Key changes:
- Replaced placeholder div with proper img element in hero section
- Added responsive image sizing with object-cover for professional appearance
- Implemented smart fallback mechanism that shows placeholder if photo not found
- Added proper accessibility with descriptive alt text
- Maintained consistent styling with rounded corners and shadow effects
- Used error handling to gracefully degrade if image file is missing

Technical implementation:
- Image path set to /helio-photo.jpg in public directory
- Added onerror handler for seamless fallback experience
- Preserved existing responsive grid layout and spacing
- Maintained design consistency with border and shadow styling

This enhancement personalizes the portfolio while maintaining the clean,
professional aesthetic inspired by Bastien Moiroux's design principles.
The implementation ensures the site works whether the photo is present or not,
providing a robust user experience.
