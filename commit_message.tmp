feat: implement email protection with JavaScript obfuscation

Add click-to-reveal email functionality to protect against bots while
maintaining user accessibility. The implementation uses Base64 encoding
and JavaScript-based email generation to hide the email address from
automated scrapers.

Changes:
- Contact section now shows "Click 'Contact me' to reveal email" initially
- Button click reveals hi@heliomedeiros.com with mailto functionality
- Footer email link also uses the protected email system
- Email is constructed using separate user/domain parts for additional obfuscation
- Includes fallback Base64 decoding method as alternative approach

This enhances security while preserving user experience and maintaining
professional contact accessibility.
