fix: remove children's names from about section for privacy

This commit updates the about section to remove specific mention of children's
names while maintaining the personal and family-oriented tone of the content.

Changes made:
- Replaced "sketching ideas with my kids Kenzo and Hiro" with "spending time with my family"
- Preserved the personal touch that shows work-life balance
- Maintained professional boundaries appropriate for a public portfolio
- Kept the content engaging while respecting family privacy

Rationale:
This change enhances privacy protection for family members while still
conveying that the professional has a well-rounded life outside of work.
The updated text maintains the same warm, personal tone without exposing
private information about children in a public-facing professional portfolio.

This ensures the website remains personal and approachable while following
best practices for online privacy and professional presentation.
