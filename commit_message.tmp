feat: implement clean minimalist design inspired by Bastien Moiroux

This commit introduces a complete redesign of the portfolio website with a
clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by Bastien Moiroux's design principles.

Key changes:
- Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 styling issues by properly importing global.css in Layout component
- Centralized all custom styles, fonts, and animations in src/styles/global.css
- Removed duplicate styles between component and global CSS files
- Added Inter font family with proper CSS custom properties
- Implemented clean typography hierarchy with bold headlines and subtle accents
- Created responsive grid layouts for hero, about, work, and contact sections
- Added smooth animations and hover effects throughout the interface
- Established consistent spacing and modern card-based design system

The new design features:
- Large, bold typography with tracking adjustments
- Strategic use of white space for visual breathing room
- Subtle gradients and modern color palette (grays with blue/purple accents)
- Professional project showcases with hover animations
- Clean contact section with the signature "hello!" message
- Fully responsive design optimized for all device sizes

This resolves styling conflicts and provides a professional, modern foundation
for the portfolio that aligns with contemporary design trends while maintaining
excellent readability and user experience.
